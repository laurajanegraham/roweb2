### HTTP Requests For R Users and Package Developers

__Scott Chamberlain__ (Session: Programming 1, Thursday)


_Many R users request data from the web in their scripts and packages. This talk introduces a modern suite of packages for managing HTTP requests. The crul package is a modern HTTP request library, including asynchronous requests, automatic handling of pagination, and more. Importantly, crul provides an R6 based object system that makes it easier to program with relative to other tools. The webmockr package mocks HTTP requests, returning user specified mocked responses matching the format of the real thing. The vcr package leverages webmockr to cache HTTP requests and responses. Both webmockr and vcr support many HTTP libraries. Last, httpcode provides information on all HTTP codes, and fauxpas provides proper HTTP error classes for use in most HTTP R libraries. These tools together provide a modern way for R programmers to manage HTTP requests._



### DRY out your workflow with the usethis package

__Jenny Bryan__ (Session: Programming 1, Thursday)


_Usethis is one of the packages created in the recent "conscious uncoupling" of the devtools package. Devtools is an established package that facilitates various aspects of package development. Never fear: devtools is alive and well and remains the public face of this functionality, but it has recently been split into a handful of more focused packages, under the hood. Usethis now holds functionality related to package and project setup. I'll explain the "conscious uncoupling" of devtools and describe the current features of usethis specifically. The DRY concept -- don't repeat yourself -- is well accepted as a best practice for code and it's an equally effective way to approach your development workflow. The usethis package offers functions that enact key steps of the package development process in a programmatic and documented way. This is an attractive alternative to doing everything by hand or, more realistically, copying and modifying files from one of your other packages. Usethis helps with initial setup and also with the sequential addition of features, such as specific dependencies (e.g. Rcpp, the pipe, the tidy eval toolkit) or practices (e.g. version control, testing, continuous integration)._


### Describing and solving differential equations with a new domain specific language, odin

__Rich Fitzjohn__ (Session: Numerical methods, Thursday)


_Solving differential equations in R presents a challenge because one must choose between implementations that are either expressive but slow to compute, or cumbersome to write but faster. I present a new package "odin" for removing this tradeoff by creating a domain specific language (DSL) hosted in R that compiles a subset of R to C for efficiently expressing and solving differential equations (JavaScript and R are compilation targets under current development). By treating the set of differential equations as a directed acyclic graph, the DSL is declarative rather than imperative. "odin" leverages the well established "deSolve" package to interface with a number of well understood solvers. I present applications of "odin" both in a research context for implementing epidemiological models with 10's of thousands of equations and in teaching contexts where we are using the introspection built into the DSL to automatically generate shiny interfaces._


### ropsec: a package for easing operations security for the R user

__Ildi Czeller__ (Session: Workflow & development lightning talks, Thursday)


_Applying security best practices is essential not only for developers or sensitive data storage but also for the everyday R user installing R packages, contributing to open source, working with APIs or remote servers. However, keeping up-to-date with security best practices and applying them meticulously requires significant effort and is difficult without expert knowledge.    The goal of the R package ropsec (github.com/ropenscilabs/ropsec) is to bring some of the best practices closer to all R users and enabling them to add a few more layers of security to their personal workstation and shared work.    In this talk I will focus on signing commits: why you should do it and how ropsec helps you do it the right way with the lowest possible risk of making a mess of your settings. I will also highlight how can you reliably test an R package whose core functionality is changing settings outside your R project.   Work on ropsec started at the 2018 ropensci unconf (unconf18.ropensci.org) and the package continuously improved since then. ropsec leverages gpg (on CRAN) that provides low-level functions for signing commits; the value added comes from the collection of high-level functions, the thorough documentation and the intuitive workflow that help R users to solve end-to-end use cases. Its aim is to mitigate the risk of doing something the user does not intend to do due to the complexity of the low level operations._
